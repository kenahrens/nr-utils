# New Relic Utils GitHub Pages site

This live GitHub page is: [here](http://kenahrens.github.io/nr-utils/index.html).

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are good at serving static content. You make a new repository and then create an orphan branch called gh-pages. Then you can put your web pages in the gh-pages branch.

To set this up yourself, follow this [article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/).

## Adding New Relic Charts

Now that you have a GH Pages static site, you can embed New Relic charts ([docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/share-your-data/embed-creating-iframes-charts)). Hit the + button at the bottom corner of any chart, and you will see an option for Embed. Copy the iframe code into your static GH Pages html and you will now have an embedded chart.
